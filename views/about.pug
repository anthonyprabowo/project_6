        p Full Stack JavaScript Developer


        .about-bio
          p I found interest in computers when I first landed a job in Fullerton College. I was a computer lab aide at that time working my way to become a computer lab technician. I worked at Fullerton College for around 2 years and I learned a lot regarding networks and servers. Moving forward to my university years, I've landed a job similar to what I had back in college. Here, at my current position I believe that I have learnt more skills, one of those being web development. 
          p Currently, I am a student at the University of California, Irvine, where I am majoring in Business Information Management. I'm considered an independent person and find excitement and joy to learn something new every day.

          p I am also a front-end web developer with skills in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I am passionate about mobile web design and providing an engaging user experience on all platforms.

          p Continual education and keeping up with the latest technology trends are both very important to me. It isnâ€™t uncommon to find me coding through the weekends at my favorite coffee shop.
